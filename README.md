1. It is part of the "Bhaashik" board project, which focuses on NLP and involves creating libraries for regional languages. This project aims to standardize these large libraries code into a single language( Python) using the OpenAI API.
2.this project is also our Intership project done under prof Dr. Anil Kumar , IITBHU .
3. This project involve the idea of making the libraries into a single programming language and Python is the best choice because of its many advantages.
4. Our Project currently aiming to Convert the large Java file into its equivalent Python file.
5.Our Project consist a python model that take the large Java file split it into multiple small java files efficiently and then convert its equivalent Python code using Openai Api and added all the chunck of converted java file.
6. there is a folder named "ModuleToConvert"  which contain the python file that convert the java file into its python equivalent , a java file for taking input javafile and the Python file for storing the output
